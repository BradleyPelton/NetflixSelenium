# THIS REPO IS STILL IN PROGRESS

## DEAR NETFLIX DEVS:
The purpose of this repo is to provide advance searching to users, an area in which your current
app falls short unfortunately. A perfect example is sorting a category by additional characteristics
(e.g. sorting Action movies by tag='Exciting'). In your current app, a user can sort movies by tag or sort by
genre, but not sort genre by tag.

Or you could always reopen the public API! 

Please kindly email me if you have any questions or concerns bradleypelton@gmail.com
